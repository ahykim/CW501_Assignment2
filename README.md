### Projects

## Simple Arithmetic Android App

This simple app takes two input text views as numerical operands to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. We chose to implement radio buttons/a spinner to allow the user to select an operator. This simple calculator also handles errors including divide by zero.

## Calculator Android App

Expanding on the app above, we made a simple calculator GUI where users should also be able to type numbers directly in the EditText. It also handles errors as well as operators like the above app.

## Two Passwords Checker Android App

An app that checks if two passwords match. It has two text fields, one label and one button. The user can enter two passwords in the text fields, which should be styled as such. When the user clicks on the button, the two passwords are compared for equality and either THANK YOU (if the passwords match) or PASSWORDS MUST MATCH (if the passwords do not match) is displayed in the label. The text fields and the label have their own separate style, each with four attributes.

## Email Validation Android App

An app that evaluates if an email is valid. The app includes an edit text field, a label and a button. The user can enter his or her email in the edit text field. When the user clicks on the button, the app checks if the email entered contains the @ character. If it does, the label displays VALID, otherwise it displays INVALID. The text field and the label have their own separate style, each with four attributes.
